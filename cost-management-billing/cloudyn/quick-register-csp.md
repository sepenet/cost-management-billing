7. Under **Invite other stakeholders**, you can add users by typing their email addresses. When complete, click **Next**. It takes about two hours for all your billing data to get added to Cloudyn.
8. Click **Go to Cloudyn** to open the Cloudyn portal and then on the **Cloud Accounts Management** page, you should see your registered CSP account information.

## Configure indirect CSP access in Cloudyn

By default, the Partner Center API is only accessible to direct CSPs. However, a direct CSP provider can configure access for their indirect CSP customers or partners using entity groups in Cloudyn.

To enable access for indirect CSP customers or partners, follow the steps in [Register with Cloudyn](#register-with-cloudyn) to set up a trial registration. Next, complete the following steps to segment indirect CSP data by using Cloudyn entity groups. Then, assign the appropriate user permissions to the entity groups.

1. Create an entity group with the information at [Create entities](tutorial-user-access.md#create-and-manage-entities).
2. Follow the steps at [Assigning subscriptions to Cost Entities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9uTWSdoQYo). Associate the indirect CSP customer's account and their Azure subscriptions to the entity that you create previously.
3. Follow the steps at [Create a user with admin access](tutorial-user-access.md#create-a-user-with-admin-access) to create a user account with Admin access. Then, ensure the user account has admin access to the specific entities that you created previously for the indirect account.

Indirect CSP partners sign in to the Cloudyn portal using the accounts that you created for them.
