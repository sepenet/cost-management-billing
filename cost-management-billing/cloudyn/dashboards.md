# View key cost metrics with dashboards

Dashboards in Cloudyn provide a high-level view of reports. Dashboards allow you to view key cost metrics in a single view. They also provide business trend highlights to help you make important business decisions.

[!INCLUDE [cloudyn-note](../../../includes/cloudyn-note.md)]

Dashboards are also used to create views for people with different responsibilities in your organization, which might include:

- Financial controller
- Application or project owner
- DevOps engineer
- Executives

Dashboards are made up of widgets and each widget is essentially a report thumbnail. Click a widget to open its report. When you customize reports, you save them to My Reports and they're added to the dashboard.

Dashboard versions differ for Management (MSP), Enterprise, and Premium Cloudyn users. The differences are determined by entity access levels. For more information about access levels, see [Entity access levels](tutorial-user-access.md#entity-access-levels).

Dashboard availability depends on the type of cloud service provider account that is used when viewing dashboards. The type of information available and collected by Cloudyn affects reports in dashboards. For example, if you don't have an AWS account then you won't see the S3 Tracker dashboard. Similarly, if you don't enable Azure Resource Manager access to Cloudyn then you won't see any Azure-specific information in Optimizer dashboard widgets.

You can use any of the premade dashboards or you can create your own dashboard with customized reports. If you're unfamiliar with Cloudyn reports, see [Use Cloudyn reports](use-reports.md).

## Create a custom dashboard

To quickly get started with a custom dashboard, you can duplicate an existing one to use its properties. Then you can modify it to suit your needs. On the dashboard you want to copy, click **Save As**. You can only duplicate customized dashboards â€” you can't duplicate the dashboards that are included with Cloudyn.

To create a custom dashboard:

1. On the homepage, click **Add New +**. The My Dashboard page is displayed.  
    ![My dashboard page where you add new reports](./media/dashboards/my-dashboard.png)
2. Click **Add New Report**. The Add Report box is displayed.
3. Select the report that you want to add to the dashboard widget. The widget is added to the dashboard.
4. Repeat the preceding steps until the dashboard is complete.
5. To change the name of the dashboard, click the name of the dashboard on the Dashboard home page and type the new name.

## Modify a custom dashboard

Like creating a custom dashboard, you can't modify the dashboards included with Cloudyn. To modify a custom dashboard report:

1. In the dashboard, find the report you want to modify and click **Edit**. The report is displayed.
2. Make any changes that you want to the report and click **Save**. The report is updated and displays your changes.

## Share a custom dashboard

You can share a custom dashboard with others to _Public_ or _My Entity_. When you share to Public, all users can view the dashboard. Only users with access to the current entity can view the dashboard when you share to My Entity. The steps to share a custom dashboard with Public and My Entity are similar.

To share a custom dashboard to Public:

1. In a dashboard, click **Dashboard Settings**. The Dashboard Settings box is displayed.  
    ![dashboard settings for a custom dashboard](./media/dashboards/dashboard-options.png)
2. In the Dashboard Settings box, click the arrow symbol and then click **Public**. The Public Dashboard confirmation dialog box is displayed.
3. Click  **Yes**. The dashboard is now available to others.

## Delete a custom dashboard report

You can delete a custom report component from the dashboard. Deleting the report from the dashboard doesn't delete the report from the reports list. Instead, deleting the report removes it from the dashboard only.

To delete a dashboard component, on the dashboard component, click **Delete**. Clicking **Delete**  immediately deletes the dashboard component.

## Share a dashboard (Enterprise)

You can share custom dashboards to all users in your organization or with the users of the current entity. Sharing a dashboard can give others a quick high-level view of your KPI. When you share a dashboard, it automatically replicates the dashboard to all your Cloudyn entities/customers. Changes to the shared dashboard are automatically updated.

To share a dashboard with all users including subentities:

1. On the dashboard home page, click **Edit**.
2. Click **Share** and then select **Public**.
3. The Global Public Dashboard confirmation box is displayed.
4. Click **Yes** to set the dashboard as a global public dashboard.

To share a dashboard with all users of a current entity:

1. From the Dashboard home page, click **Edit**.
2. Click **Share** and then select **My Entity**.
3. Click **Yes** to set the dashboard as a public dashboard.

## Duplicate a custom dashboard

When you create a new dashboard, you might want to use similar properties from an existing dashboard. You can duplicate the dashboard to create a new one.

You can only duplicate custom dashboards. You can't duplicate standard dashboards.

To duplicate (clone) a custom dashboard:

1. On the Dashboard that you want to duplicate, click **Save As**. A new dashboard opens with the same name and a number.
2. Rename the duplicated dashboard and modify it as you like.

-Or-

1. In Dashboard Settings, click **Save As**  on the line of the dashboard that you want to duplicate.
2. The duplicated dashboard opens.
3. Rename the dashboard and modify it as you like.

## Set a default dashboard

You can set any dashboard as your default. Setting it to your default makes it appear as the left-most tab in the dashboard tab list. The default dashboard displays when open the Cloudyn portal.

- Click the dashboard tab you would like to set as default, then click **Default** on the right.

-Or-

1. Click **Dashboard Settings** to see the list of available dashboards and select the dashboard that you want to set as the default.
