# Tutorial: Review usage and costs

Cloudyn shows you usage and costs so that you can track trends, detect inefficiencies, and create alerts. All usage and cost data is displayed in Cloudyn dashboards and reports. The examples in this tutorial walk you though reviewing usage and costs using dashboards and reports.

Azure Cost Management offers similar functionality to Cloudyn. Azure Cost Management is a native Azure cost management solution. It helps you analyze costs, create and manage budgets, export data, and review and act on optimization recommendations to save money. For more information, see [Azure Cost Management](../cost-management-billing-overview.md).

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Track usage and cost trends
> * Detect usage inefficiencies
> * Create alerts for unusual spending or overspending
> * Export data

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a  [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

[!INCLUDE [cloudyn-note](../../../includes/cloudyn-note.md)]

## Prerequisites

- You must have an Azure account.
- You must have either a trial registration or paid subscription for Cloudyn.

## Open the Cloudyn portal

You review all usage and costs in the Cloudyn portal. Open the Cloudyn portal from the Azure portal or navigate to https://azure.cloudyn.com and sign in.

## Track usage and cost trends

You track actual money spent for usage and costs with Over Time reports to identify trends. To start looking at trends, use the Actual Cost Over Time report. On the top left of the portal, click **Costs** > **Cost Analysis** > **Actual Cost Over Time**. When you first open the report, no groups or filters are applied to it.

Here is an example report:

![Example Actual Cost Over Time report](./media/tutorial-review-usage/actual-cost01.png)

The report shows all spending over the last 30 days. To view only spending for Azure services, apply the Service group and then filter for all Azure services. The following image shows the filtered services.

![Example showing filtered Azure services](./media/tutorial-review-usage/actual-cost02.png)

In the preceding example, less money was spent starting on 2018-10-29. But, too many columns can obscure an obvious trend. You can change the report view to a line or area chart to see the data displayed in other views. The following image shows the trend more clearly.

![Example showing a decreasing Azure VM cost trend](./media/tutorial-review-usage/actual-cost03.png)

Continuing with the example, you can see that the cost for Azure VM dropped. Costs for other Azure services also started dropping on that day. So, what caused that reduction in spending? In this example, a large work project was completed so consumption of many Azure services also dropped.

## Detect usage inefficiencies

Optimizer reports improve efficiency, optimize usage, and identify ways to save money spent on your cloud resources. They are especially helpful with cost-effective sizing recommendations intended to help reduce idle or expensive VMs.

A common problem that affects organizations when they initially move resources in to the cloud is their virtualization strategy. They often use an approach similar to the one they used for creating virtual machines for the on-premises virtualization environment. And, they assume that costs are reduced by moving their on-premises VMs to the cloud, as-is. However, that approach is not likely to reduce costs.

The problem is that their existing infrastructure was already paid for. Users could create and keep large VMs running if they likedâ€”idle or not and with little consequence. Moving large or idle VMs to the cloud is likely to *increase* costs. Cost allocation for resources is important when you enter into agreements with cloud service providers. You must pay for what you commit to whether you use the resource fully or not.

The Cost Effective Sizing Recommendations report identifies potential annual savings by comparing VM instance type capacity to their historical CPU and memory usage data.  

On the menu at the top of the portal, click **Optimizer** > **Sizing Optimization** > **Cost Effective Sizing Recommendations**. If useful, apply a filter to reduce results. Here's an example image.

![Cost effective sizing recommendation report for Azure VMs](./media/tutorial-review-usage/sizing01.png)

In this example, $2,382 could be saved by following the recommendations to change the VM instance types. Click the plus symbol (+) under **Details** for the first recommendation. Here are details about the first recommendation.

![Example showing recommendation details](./media/tutorial-review-usage/sizing02.png)

View VM instance IDs by clicking the plus symbol next to **List of Candidates**.

To watch a tutorial video about detecting usage inefficiencies, see [Optimizing VM Size in Cloudyn](https://youtu.be/1xaZBNmV704).

Azure Cost Management also provides cost-saving recommendations for Azure services. For more information, see [Tutorial: Optimize costs from recommendations](../costs/tutorial-acm-opt-recommendations.md).

## Create alerts for unusual spending

Alerts allow you to automatically notify stakeholders of spending anomalies and overspending risks. You can create alerts using reports that support alerts based on budget and cost thresholds.

This example uses the **Actual Cost Over Time** report to send a notification when your spending on an Azure VM  nears your total budget. In this scenario, you have a total budget of $20,000 and you want to receive a notification when costs are approaching half of your budget, $9,000, and an additional alert when costs reach $10,000.

1. From the menu at the top of the Cloudyn portal, select **Costs** > **Cost Analysis** > **Actual Cost Over Time**.
2. Set **Groups** to **Service** and set **Filter on the service** to **Azure/VM**.
3. In the top right of the report, select **Actions** and then select **Schedule report**.
4. To send yourself an email of the report at scheduled interval, select the **Scheduling** tab in the **Save or Schedule this** report dialog. Be sure to select **Send via email**. Any tags, grouping, and filtering you use are included in the emailed report.
5. Select the **Threshold** tab and then select  **Actual Cost vs. Threshold**.
   1. In the **Red alert** threshold box enter 10000.
   2. In the **Yellow alert** threshold box enter 9000.
   3. In the **Number of consecutive alerts** box, enter the number of consecutive alerts to receive. When you receive the total number of alerts that you specified, no additional alerts are sent.
6. Select **Save**.

![Example showing red and yellow alerts based on spending thresholds](./media/tutorial-review-usage/schedule-alert01.png)

You can also choose the **Cost Percentage vs. Budget** threshold metric to create alerts. This allows you to specify the thresholds as percentages of your budget instead of currency values.

## Export data

Similar to way you create alerts for reports, you can also export data from any report. For example, you might want to export a list of Cloudyn accounts or other user data. To export any report, open the report and then in the top right of the report, click **Actions**. Some of the actions you might want to take are **Export all report data** so that you can download or print the information. Or, you can select **Schedule report** to schedule the report to get sent as an email.
