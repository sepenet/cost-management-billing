## Azure Reservation 
### Why 
**Save Money** with Azure reservation.  
Learn how Azure Reservations help you save money by committing to one-year or three-years plans for virtual machines, Azure Blob storage or Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, SQL Database compute capacity, Azure Cosmos DB throughput, and other Azure resources.  

The above lines are the exhibit of the official online documentation available [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/reservations/)

### to know 
- All reservations, except Azure Databricks, are applied on an **hourly basis**
- Unused reserved capacity doesn't carry over from one hour to next, in other words unused reserved capacity is **lost**
- Usage exceeding the reserved quantity is charged using more expensive pay-as-you-go rates
- VM reservation is tied to a VM series  
> [!NOTE]
> Reservation purchased for ES series VMs don't apply to E series VMs, and vice-versa.
