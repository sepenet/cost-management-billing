# Save costs for Azure App Service Isolated Stamp Fee with reserved capacity

You can save money on Azure App Service Isolated Stamp Fees by committing to a reservation for your stamp usage for a duration of three years. To purchase Isolated Stamp Fee reserved capacity, you need to choose the Azure region where the stamp will be deployed and the number of stamps to purchase.

When you purchase a reservation, the Isolated Stamp Fee usage that matches the reservation attributes is no longer charged at the pay-as-you go rates. The reservation is applied automatically to the number of Isolated stamps that match the reserved capacity scope and region. You don't need to assign a reservation to an isolated stamp. The reservation doesn't apply to workers, so any other resources associated with the stamp are charged separately.

When the reserved capacity expires, Isolated Stamps continue to run but they're billed at the pay-as-you go rate. Reservations don't renew automatically.

## Determine the right reservation to purchase

By purchasing a reservation, you're committing to using reserved quantities over next three years. Check your usage data to determine how many App Service Isolated Stamps you're consistently using and might use in the future.

Additionally, make sure you understand how the Isolated Stamp emits Linux or Windows meter.

- By default, an empty Isolated Stamp emits the Windows stamp meter. For example, with no workers deployed. It continues to emit this meter if Windows workers are deployed on the stamp.
- The meter changes to the Linux stamp meter if you deploy a Linux worker.
- In cases where both Linux and Windows workers are deployed, the stamp emits the Windows meter.

So, the stamp meter can change between Windows and Linux over the life of the stamp.

Buy Windows stamp reservations if you have one or more Windows workers on the stamp. The only time you should purchase a Linux stamp reservation is if you plan to _only_ have Linux workers on the stamp.
