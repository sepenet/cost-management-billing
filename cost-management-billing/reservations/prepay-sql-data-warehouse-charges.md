# Save costs for Azure Synapse Analytics charges with reserved capacity

You can save money with Azure Synapse Analytics by committing to a reservation for your cDWU usage for a duration of one or three years. To purchase Azure Synapse Analytics reserved capacity, you need to choose the Azure region, and term. Then, add the Azure Synapse Analytics SKU to your cart and choose the quantity of cDWU units that you want to purchase.

When you purchase a reservation, the Azure Synapse Analytics usage that matches the reservation attributes is no longer charged at the pay-as-you go rates.

A reservation doesn't cover storage or networking charges associated with the Azure Synapse Analytics usage.

When the reserved capacity expires, Azure Synapse Analytics instances continue to run but are billed at the pay-as-you go rate. Reservations don't renew automatically.

For pricing information, see the [Azure Synapse Analytics reserved capacity offering](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/synapse-analytics/).

You can buy Azure Synapse Analytics reserved capacity in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Reservations/ReservationsBrowseBlade). Pay for the reservation [up front or with monthly payments](monthly-payments-reservations.md). To buy reserved capacity:

- You must have the owner role for at least one enterprise or Pay-As-You-Go subscription.
- For Enterprise subscriptions, the **Add Reserved Instances** option must be enabled in the [EA portal](https://ea.azure.com/). If the setting is disabled, you must be an EA Admin.
- For the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program, only the admin agents or sales agents can purchase Azure Synapse Analytics reserved capacity.

For more information about how enterprise customers and Pay-As-You-Go customers are charged for reservation purchases, see [understand Azure reservation usage for your Enterprise enrollment](understand-reserved-instance-usage-ea.md) and [understand Azure reservation usage for your Pay-As-You-Go subscription](understand-reserved-instance-usage.md).

## Choose the right size before purchase

The Azure Synapse Analytics reservation size should be based on the total compute data warehouse units (cDWU) that you consume. Purchases are made in 100 cDWU increments.

For example, assume your total consumption of Azure Synapse Analytics is DW3000c. You want to purchase reserved capacity for all of it. So, you should purchase 30 units of cDWU reserved capacity.
