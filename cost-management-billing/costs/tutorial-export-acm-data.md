# Tutorial: Create and manage exported data

If you read the Cost Analysis tutorial, then you're familiar with manually downloading your Cost Management data. However, you can create a recurring task that automatically exports your Cost Management data to Azure storage on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. Exported data is in CSV format and it contains all the information that's collected by Cost Management. You can then use the exported data in Azure storage with external systems and combine it with your own custom data. And you can use your exported data in an external system like a dashboard or other financial system.

Watch the [How to schedule exports to storage with Azure Cost Management](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWa_xI1aRzo) video about creating a scheduled export of your Azure cost data to Azure Storage. To watch other videos, visit the [Cost Management YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/AzureCostManagement).

The examples in this tutorial walk you though exporting your cost management data and then verify that the data was successfully exported.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> * Verify that data is collected

## Prerequisites
Data export is available for a variety of Azure account types, including [Enterprise Agreement (EA)](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/enterprise-agreement/) and [Microsoft Customer Agreement](get-started-partners.md) customers. To view the full list of supported account types, see [Understand Cost Management data](understand-cost-mgt-data.md). The following Azure permissions, or scopes, are supported per subscription for data export by user and group. For more information about scopes, see [Understand and work with scopes](understand-work-scopes.md).

- Owner – Can create, modify, or delete scheduled exports for a subscription.
- Contributor – Can create, modify, or delete their own scheduled exports. Can modify the name of scheduled exports created by others.
- Reader – Can schedule exports that they have permission to.

For Azure Storage accounts:
- Write permissions are required to change the configured storage account, regardless of permissions on the export.
- Your Azure storage account must be configured for blob or file storage.

If you have a new subscription, you can't immediately use Cost Management features. It might take up to 48 hours before you can use all Cost Management features.

## Sign in to Azure
Sign in to the Azure portal at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com/).

## Create a daily export

To create or view a data export or to schedule an export, open the desired scope in the Azure portal and select **Cost analysis** in the menu. For example, navigate to **Subscriptions**, select a subscription from the list, and then select **Cost analysis** in the menu. At the top of the Cost analysis page, select **Export** and then choose an export option. For example, select **Schedule export**.  

> [!NOTE]
> - Besides subscriptions, you can create exports on resource groups, accounts, departments, and enrollments. For more information about scopes, see [Understand and work with scopes](understand-work-scopes.md).
>- When you're signed in as a partner at the billing account scope or on a customer's tenant, you can export data to an Azure Storage account that's linked to your partner storage account. However, you must have an active subscription in your CSP tenant.

Select **Add**, type a name for the export, and then select the **Daily export of month-to-date costs** option. Select **Next**.

Specify the subscription for your Azure storage account, then select your storage account.  Specify the storage container and the directory path that you'd like the export file to go to. Select **Next**.

![New export example showing storage account details](./media/tutorial-export-acm-data/storage_exports.png)

Review your export details and select **Create**.

Your new export appears in the list of exports. By default, new exports are enabled. If you want to disable or delete a scheduled export, select any item in the list and then select either **Disable** or **Delete**.

Initially, it can take one to two hours before the export runs. However, it can take up to four hours before data is shown in exported files.

### Export schedule

Scheduled exports are affected by the time and day of week of when you initially create the export. When you create a scheduled export, the export runs at the same frequency for each subsequent export occurrence. For example, for a month-to-date export set at a daily frequency, the export runs daily. Similarly for a weekly export, the export runs every week on the same day as it is scheduled. The exact delivery time of the export is not guaranteed and the exported data is available within four hours of run time."
Each export creates a new file, so older exports are not overwritten.

There are two types of export options:

**Daily export of month-to-date costs** – The initial export runs immediately. Subsequent exports run the next day at the same time as the initial export. The latest data is aggregated from previous daily exports.

**Custom** – Allows you to schedule weekly and monthly exports with week-to-date and month-to-date options. *The initial export will run immediately.*

If you have a Pay-As-You-Go, MSDN, or Visual Studio subscription, your invoice billing period might not align to the calendar month. For those types of subscriptions and resource groups, you can create an export that's aligned to your invoice period or to calendar months. To create an export aligned to your invoice month, navigate to **Custom**, then select **Billing-period-to-date**.  To create an export aligned to the calendar month, select **Month-to-date**.

## Verify that data is collected

You can easily verify that your Cost Management data is being collected and view the exported CSV file using Azure Storage Explorer.

In the export list, select the storage account name. On the storage account page, select Open in Explorer. If you see a confirmation box, select **Yes** to open the file in Azure Storage Explorer.

![Storage account page showing example information and link to Open in Explorer](./media/tutorial-export-acm-data/storage-account-page.png)

In Storage Explorer, navigate to the container that you want to open and select the folder corresponding to the current month. A list of CSV files is shown. Select one and then select **Open**.

![Example information shown in Storage Explorer](./media/tutorial-export-acm-data/storage-explorer.png)

The file opens with the program or application that's set to open CSV file extensions. Here's an example in Excel.

## Access exported data from other systems

One of the purposes of exporting your Cost Management data is to access the data from external systems. You might use a dashboard system or other financial system. Such systems vary widely so showing an example wouldn't be practical.  However, you can get started with accessing your data from you applications at [Introduction to Azure Storage](../../storage/common/storage-introduction.md).
