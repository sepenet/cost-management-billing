# Terms in the Azure usage and charges file for a Microsoft Customer Agreement

This article applies to a billing account for a Microsoft Customer Agreement. [Check if you have access to a Microsoft Customer Agreement](#check-access-to-a-microsoft-customer-agreement).

The Azure usage and charges CSV file contains daily and meter-level usage charges for the current billing period.

To get your Azure usage and charges file, see [View and download Azure usage and charges for your Microsoft Customer Agreement](download-azure-daily-usage.md). It's available in a comma-separated values (.csv) file format that you can open in a spreadsheet application.

Usage charges are the total **monthly** charges on a subscription. The usage charges don't take into account any credits or discounts.

## Changes from Azure EA usage and charges

If you were an EA customer, you'll notice that the terms in the Azure billing profile usage CSV file differ from the terms in the Azure EA usage CSV file. Here's a mapping of EA usage terms to billing profile usage terms:
