# Get billing ownership of Azure subscriptions to your MPA account

To provide a single consolidated invoice for managed services and Azure consumption, Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) can take over billing ownership of Azure subscriptions from their customers with Direct Enterprise Agreement (EA).

This feature is available only for CSP Direct Bill Partners certified as [Azure Expert MSP](https://partner.microsoft.com/membership/azure-expert-msp). It is subject to Microsoft governance and policies and might require review and approval for certain customers.

To request the billing ownership, you must have **Global Admin** or **Admin Agents** role. To learn more, see [Partner Center - Assign users roles and permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/permissions-overview).

This article applies to billing accounts for Microsoft Partner Agreements. These accounts are created for Cloud Solution Providers (CSPs) to manage billing for their customers in the new commerce experience. The new experience is only available for partners, who have at least one customer that has accepted a Microsoft Customer Agreement(MCA) and has an Azure Plan. [Check if you have access to a Microsoft Partner Agreement](#check-access-to-a-microsoft-partner-agreement).

## Prerequisites

1. Establish [reseller relationship](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/request-a-relationship-with-a-customer) with the customer. Check [CSP Regional Authorization Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/regional-authorization-overview) to ensure both customer and Partner tenant are within the same authorized regions.  

2. [Confirm customer has accepted the Microsoft Customer Agreement](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/confirm-customer-agreement).

3. Setup [Azure plan](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/purchase-azure-plan) for the customer. If the customer is purchasing through multiple resellers, you need to setup Azure plan for each combination of a customer and a reseller.

## Request billing ownership

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using CSP Admin Agent credentials.

2. Search for **Cost Management + Billing**.

## Supported subscription types

You can request billing ownership of the subscription types listed below.

- [Enterprise Dev/Test](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0148p/)\*
- [Microsoft Enterprise Agreement](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/enterprise-agreement/)

\* A Dev/Test subscription must first be converted to an EA Enterprise offer via a support ticket. An Enterprise Dev/Test subscription will be billed at a pay-as-you-go rate after it's transferred. Any discount offered via the Enterprise Dev/Test offer through the customer's EA will not be available to the CSP partner.

## Additional information

The following section provides additional information about transferring subscriptions.

### No service downtime

Azure services in the subscription keep running without any interruption. We only transition the billing relationship for the Azure subscriptions that the user selects to transfer.

### Disabled subscriptions

Disabled subscriptions can't be transferred. Subscriptions must be in active state to transfer their billing ownership.

### Azure resources transfer

All resources from the subscriptions like VMs, disks, and websites transfer.

### Azure Marketplace products transfer

Azure Marketplace products which are available for subscriptions that are managed by Cloud Solution Providers (CSPs) are transferred along with their respective subscriptions. Subscriptions that have Azure Marketplace products that are not enabled for CSPs can't be transferred.

### Azure Reservations transfer

Azure Reservations don't automatically move with subscriptions. Either you can keep the Reservation in EAfor other subscriptions or [cancel the Reservation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/reservations/exchange-and-refund-azure-reservations) and partner can repurchase in CSP. 

### Access to Azure services

Access for existing users, groups, or service principals that was assigned using [Azure RBAC (role-based access control)](../../role-based-access-control/overview.md) is not affected during the transition. The partner wonâ€™t get any new RBAC access to the subscriptions.  

The partners should work with the customer to get access to  subscriptions.  The partners needs to get  either [Admin on Behalf Of - AOBO](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/cspdev/Module-11-Admin-On-Behalf-Of-AOBO) or [Azure Lighthouse](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/lighthouse/concepts/cloud-solution-provider) access open support tickets.

### Azure support plan

Azure support doesn't transfer with the subscriptions. If the user transfers all Azure subscriptions, ask them to cancel their support plan. After the transfer, CSP partner is responsible for the support. The customer should work with CSP partner for any support request.  

### Charges for transferred subscription

The original billing owner of the subscriptions is responsible for any charges that were reported up to the point that the transfer is completed. You are  responsible for charges reported from the time of transfer onwards. There may be some charges that took place before transfer but was reported afterwards. These charges show up on your invoice.

### Cancel a transfer request

You can cancel the transfer request until the request is approved or declined. To cancel the transfer request, go to the [transfer details page](#check-the-transfer-request-status) and select cancel from the bottom of the page.

### Software as a Service (SaaS) transfer

SaaS products don't transfer with the subscriptions. Ask the user to [Contact Azure support](https://portal.azure.com/?#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade) to transfer billing ownership of SaaS products. Along with the billing ownership, the user can also transfer resource ownership. Resource ownership lets you perform management operations like deleting and viewing the details of the product. User must be a resource owner on the SaaS product to transfer resource ownership.

### Additional approval for certain customers

Some of the customer transition requests may require an additional review process with Microsoft due to the nature of the current enterprise enrollment structure of the customer. Partner will be notified of such requirements when trying to send an invite to customers. Partners are requested to work with their Partner Development Manager and Customerâ€™s account team to complete this review process.

### Azure subscription directory
The directory of the Azure subscriptions that are transferred must match the directory of the customer that was selected while establishing the CSP relationship.

If these two directories donâ€™t match, the subscriptions couldn't be transferred. You need to either establish a new CSP reseller relationship with the customer by selecting the directory of the Azure subscriptions or change the directory of Azure subscriptions to match with the customer CSP relationship directory. For more information, see [Associate an existing subscription to your Azure AD directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-how-subscriptions-associated-directory#to-associate-an-existing-subscription-to-your-azure-ad-directory).
