# Pay for your Azure subscription by invoice

If you switch to pay by invoice, that means you pay your bill within 30 days of the invoice date by check/wire transfer. To become eligible to pay for your Azure subscription by invoice, submit a request to Azure support. Once your request is approved, you can switch to invoice pay (check/wire transfer) in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> * Invoice pay (check/wire transfer) is only available for customers using Azure on behalf of a company.
> * Pay all outstanding charges before switching to invoice pay.
> * Currently, invoice payment isn't supported for Global Azure in China.
