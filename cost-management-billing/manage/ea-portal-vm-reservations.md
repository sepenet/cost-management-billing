# Azure EA VM reserved instances

This article summaries how Azure reservations for VM reserved instances can help you save you money with your enterprise enrollment. For more information about reservations, see [What are Azure Reservations?](../reservations/save-compute-costs-reservations.md).

## Reservation exchanges and refunds

You can exchange a reservation for another reservation of the same type. It's also possible to refund a reservation, up to $50,000 USD per year, if you no longer need it. The Azure portal can be used to exchange or refund a reservation. For more information, see [Self-service exchanges and refunds for Azure Reservations](../reservations/exchange-and-refund-azure-reservations.md).

## Reservation costs and usage

Enterprise agreement customers can view cost and usage data in the Azure portal and REST APIs. For reservation costs and usage, you can:

- Get reservation purchase data.
- Know which subscription, resource group, or resource used a reservation.
- Chargeback for reservation utilization.
- Calculate reservation savings.
- Get reservation under-utilization data.
- Amortize reservation costs.

For more information about reservation costs and usage, see [Get Enterprise Agreement reservation costs and usage](../reservations/understand-reserved-instance-usage-ea.md).

For information about pricing, see [Linux Virtual Machines Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-machines/linux/) or [Windows Virtual Machines Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-machines/windows/).

## Reserved instances API support

You can use Azure APIs to programmatically get information for your organization about Azure service or software reservations. For more information, see [APIs for Azure reservation automation](../reservations/reservation-apis.md).

## Azure reserved virtual machine instances

Reserved instances can reduce your virtual machine costs up to 72 percent over Pay-As-You-Go prices on all VMs, or up to 82 percent savings when combined with the Azure hybrid benefit. It's possible to prioritize your workloads, budget, and forecast better with upfront payment for on-year or three-year terms. You can also exchange or cancel reservations as business needs change.

### How to buy reserved virtual machine instances

To purchase an Azure reserved virtual machine instance, an Enterprise Azure enrollment admin must enable the _Reserve Instance_ purchase option in the _Enrollment Detail_ section on the _Enrollment_ tab in the [Azure EA Portal](https://ea.azure.com/).

Once the EA enrollment is enabled to add reserved instances, any account owner with an active subscription associated to the EA enrollment can buy a reserved virtual machine instance in the [Azure portal](https://aka.ms/reservations). For more information, see [Prepay for virtual machines and save money with Reserved Virtual Machine Instances](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=861721).

### How to view reserved instance purchase details

You can view your reserved instance purchase details via the _Reservations_ menu on the left side of the [Azure portal](https://aka.ms/reservations) or from the [Azure EA portal](https://ea.azure.com/). Select **Reports** from the left-side menu and scroll down to the _Charges by Services_ section on the _Usage Summary_ Tab. Scroll to the bottom of the section and your reserved instance purchases and usage will list at the end as indicated by the '1 year' or '3 years' designation next to the service name, for example: Standard_DS1_v2 eastus 1 year or Standard_D2s_v3 eastus2 3 years.

### How can I change the subscription associated with reserved instance or transfer my reserved instance benefits to a subscription under the same account?

You can change the subscription that receives reserved instance benefits by:

- Signing in to the [Azure portal](https://aka.ms/reservations).
- Updating the applied subscription scope by associating a different subscription under the same account.

For more information about changing the scope of a reservation, see [Change the reservation scope](../reservations/manage-reserved-vm-instance.md#change-the-reservation-scope).

### How to view reserved instance usage details

You can view your reserved instance usage detail in the [Azure portal](https://aka.ms/reservations) or in the [Azure EA portal](https://ea.azure.com/) (for EA customers who have access to view billing information) under _Reports_ > _Usage Summary_ > _Charges by Services_. Your reserved instances can be identified as service names containing 'Reservation', for example: Reservation-Base VM or Virtual Machines Reservation-Windows Svr (1 Core).

Your usage detail and advanced report download CSV contain additional reserved instance usage information. The _Additional Info_ field will help you identify the reserved instance usage.

If you did not use the Azure hybrid benefit to purchase Azure reserved VM instances, reserved instances will emit two meters (hardware and software). If you used the Azure hybrid benefit to purchase reserved instance, you will not see the software meter in your reserved instance usage detail.

### Reserved instance billing

For enterprise customers, monetary commitment is used to purchase Azure reserved VM instances. If your enrollment has enough monetary commitment balance to cover the reserved instance purchase, the amount will be deducted from your monetary commitment balance and you will not receive an invoice for the purchase.

In scenarios where Azure EA customers have used all their monetary commitment, reserved instances can still be purchased, and those purchases will be invoiced on your next overage bill. Reserved instance overage, if any, will be part of your regular overage invoice.

### Reserved instance expiration

You'll receive email notifications 30 days before reservation and at expiration. Once the reservation expires, deployed VMs will continue to run and be billed at a pay-as-you-go rate.
