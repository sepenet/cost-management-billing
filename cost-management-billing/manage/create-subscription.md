# Create an additional Azure subscription

You can create an additional subscription for your [Enterprise Agreement (EA)](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/enterprise-agreement/), [Microsoft Customer Agreement](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/microsoft-customer-agreement/) or [Microsoft Partner Agreement](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/news/introducing-microsoft-partner-agreement) billing account in the Azure portal. You may want an additional subscription to avoid hitting subscription limits, to create separate environments for security, or to isolate data for compliance reasons.

If you have a Microsoft Online Service Program (MOSP) billing account, you can create additional subscriptions in the [Azure sign up portal](https://account.azure.com/signup?offer=ms-azr-0003p).

To learn more about billing accounts and identify the type of your billing account, see [View billing accounts in Azure portal](view-all-accounts.md).
