# Complete Enterprise Agreement tasks in your billing account for a Microsoft Customer Agreement

If your organization has signed a Microsoft Customer Agreement to renew your Enterprise Agreement enrollment, a new billing account is created for the agreement. The billing in your new account is organized differently than your Enterprise Agreement. This article describes how you can use the new billing account to perform tasks that you performed in your Enterprise Agreement.

## Billing organization in the new account

The following diagram describes how billing is organized in your new billing account.

| Enterprise Agreement   | Microsoft Customer Agreement    |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Enrollment            | You use a billing profile to manage billing for your organization, similar to your Enterprise Agreement enrollment. Enterprise administrators become owners of the billing profile. To learn more about billing profiles, see [Understand billing profiles](../understand/mca-overview.md#billing-profiles).
| Department            | You use an invoice section to organize your costs, similar to departments in your Enterprise Agreement enrollment. Department becomes invoice sections and department administrators become owners of the respective invoice sections. To learn more about invoice sections, see [Understand invoice sections](../understand/mca-overview.md#invoice-sections). |
| Account               | The accounts that were created in your Enterprise Agreement aren't supported in the new billing account. The account's subscriptions belong to the respective invoice section for their department. Account owners can create and manage subscriptions for their invoice sections. |

## Changes for enterprise administrators

The following changes apply to enterprise administrators on an Enterprise Agreement that got renewed to a Microsoft Customer Agreement.

- A billing profile is created for your enrollment. You'll use the billing profile to manage billing for your organization, like your Enterprise Agreement enrollment. To learn more about billing profiles, [understand billing profiles](../understand/mca-overview.md#billing-profiles).
- An invoice section is created for each department in your Enterprise Agreement enrollment. You'll use the invoice sections to manage your departments. You can create new invoice sections to set up additional departments. To learn more about invoice sections, see [understand invoice sections](../understand/mca-overview.md#invoice-sections).
- You'll use the Azure subscription creator role on invoice sections to give others permission to create Azure subscription, like the accounts that were created in Enterprise Agreement enrollment.
- You'll use the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) to manage billing for your organization, instead of the Azure EA portal.

You are given the following roles on the new billing account:

**Billing profile owner** - You are assigned the billing profile owner role on the billing profile that was created when the agreement was signed. The role lets you manage the billing for your organization. You can view charges and invoices, organize costs on the invoice, manage payment methods, and control access to your organization's billing.

**Invoice section owner** - You are assigned the invoice section owner role on all invoice sections that are created for the departments in your Enterprise Agreement enrollment. The role lets you control who can create Azure subscriptions and purchase other products.
