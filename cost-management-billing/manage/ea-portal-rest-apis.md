# Azure Enterprise REST APIs

This article describes the REST APIs for use with your Azure enterprise enrollment. It also explains how to resolve common issues with REST APIs.

## Consumption and Usage APIs

Microsoft Enterprise Azure customers can get usage and billing information through REST APIs. The role owner (Enterprise Administrator, Department Administrator, Account Owner) must enable access to the API by generating a key from the Azure EA portal. Then, anyone provided with the enrollment number and key can access the data through the API.

### Available APIs

**Balance and Summary -** The [Balance and Summary API](../../billing/billing-enterprise-api-balance-summary.md) provides a monthly summary of information about balances, new purchases, Azure Marketplace service charges, adjustments, and overage charges. For more information, see [Reporting APIs for Enterprise customers - Balance and Summary](/rest/api/billing/enterprise/billing-enterprise-api-balance-summary).

**Usage Detail -** The [Usage Detail API](../../billing/billing-enterprise-api-usage-detail.md) provides a daily breakdown of consumed quantities and estimated charges by an enrollment. The result also includes information about instances, meters, and departments. You can query the API by billing period or by a specified start and end date. For more information, see [Reporting APIs for Enterprise customers - Usage Details](/rest/api/billing/enterprise/billing-enterprise-api-usage-detail).

**Marketplace Store Charge -** The [Marketplace Store Charge API](../../billing/billing-enterprise-api-marketplace-storecharge.md) returns usage-based marketplace charges, broken down day for the specified billing period or start and end dates. For more information, see [Reporting APIs for Enterprise customers - Marketplace Store Charge](/rest/api/billing/enterprise/billing-enterprise-api-marketplace-storecharge).

**Price Sheet -** The [Price Sheet API](/rest/api/billing/enterprise/billing-enterprise-api-pricesheet) provides the applicable rate for each meter for an enrollment and billing period. For more information, see [Reporting APIs for Enterprise customers - Price Sheet](/rest/api/billing/enterprise/billing-enterprise-api-pricesheet).

**Billing Periods -** The [Billing Periods API](../../billing/billing-enterprise-api-billing-periods.md) returns a list of billing periods that have consumption data for an enrollment in reverse chronological order. Each period contains a property pointing to the API route for the four sets of data, BalanceSummary, UsageDetails, Marketplace Charges, and PriceSheet. For more information, see [Reporting APIs for Enterprise customers - Billing Periods](/rest/api/billing/enterprise/billing-enterprise-api-billing-periods).

### Enable API data access

Role owners can perform the following steps in the Azure EA portal. Navigate to **Reports** > **Download Usage** > **API Access Key**. Then they can:

- Generate primary and secondary access keys.
- Disable access keys.
- View start and end dates of access keys.

### Generate or retrieve the API Key

1. Sign in as an enterprise administrator.
2. Click **Reports** on the left navigation window and then click the **Download Usage** tab.
3. Click **API Access Key**.
4. Under **Enrollment Access Keys**, select the generate key symbol to generate either a primary or secondary key.
5. Select **Expand Key** to view the entire generated API access key.
6. Select **Copy** to get the API access key for immediate use.

![Example showing API Access Key page](./media/ea-portal-rest-apis/ea-create-generate-or-retrieve-the-api-key.png)

If you want to give the API access keys to people who aren't enterprise administrators in your enrollment, perform the following steps:

1. In the left navigation window, click **Manage**.
2. Click the pencil symbol next to **DA view charges** (Department Administrator view charges).
3. Select **Enable** and then click **Save**.
4. Click the pencil symbol next to **AO view charges** (Account Owner view charges).
5. Select **Enable** and then click **Save**.

![Example showing DA and AO view charges enabled](./media/ea-portal-rest-apis/create-ea-generate-or-retrieve-api-key-enable-ao-do-view.png)
The preceding steps give API access key holders with access to cost and pricing information in usage reports.

### Pass keys in the API

Pass the API key for each call for authentication and authorization. Pass the following property to HTTP headers:

| Request header key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Authorization | Specify the value in this format: **bearer {API\_KEY}**
Example: bearer \&lt;APIKey\&gt; |

### Swagger

A Swagger endpoint is available at [Enterprise Reporting v3 APIs](https://consumption.azure.com/swagger/ui/index)for the following APIs. Swagger helps inspect the API. Use Swagger to generate client SDKs using [AutoRest](https://github.com/Azure/AutoRest) or [Swagger CodeGen](https://swagger.io/swagger-codegen/). Data available after May 1, 2014 is available through the API.

### API response codes

When you're using an API, response status codes are shown. The following table describes them.

| Response status code | Message | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 200 | OK | No error |
| 401 | Unauthorized | API Key not found, Invalid, Expired etc. |
| 404 | Unavailable | Report endpoint not found |
| 400 | Bad Request | Invalid parameters â€“ Date ranges, EA numbers etc. |
| 500 | Server Error | Unexpected error processing request |

### Usage and billing data update frequency

Usage and billing data files are updated every 24 hours for the current billing month. However, data latency can occur for up to three days. For example, if usage is incurred on Monday, data might not appear in the data file until Thursday.

### Test enrollment for development

If you're a partner or a developer without an Azure enterprise enrollment and you want to access the API, you can use the test enrollment. The enrollment name is _EnrollmentNumber 100_, you can find and test usage information up to June 2018. Then you can use the following key to call the API and see sample data.

### Azure service catalog

All Azure services are posted to a catalog in CSV format in an Azure storage blog. The catalog is useful if you need to build a curated catalog of all Azure services for your system. The current catalog is at [https://azurecatalog.blob.core.windows.net/catalog/AzureCatalog.csv](https://azurecatalog.blob.core.windows.net/catalog/AzureCatalog.csv).

### CSV data file details

The following information describes the properties of API reports.

#### Usage summary

JSON format is generated from the CSV report. As a result, the format is same as the summary CSV format. The column name is wielded, so you should deserialize into a data table when you consume the JSON summary data.

### Common API issues

As you use Azure Enterprise REST APIs, you might encounter any of the following common issues.

You might try to use an API key that doesn't have the correct authorization type. API keys are generated by:

- Enterprise Administrator
- Department Administrator (DA)
- Account Owner (AO)

A key generated by the EA admin gives access to all information for that enrollment. A read-only EA admin can't generate an API key.

A key generated by a DA or AO doesn't provide access to balance, charge, and price sheet information.

An API key expires every six months. If expired, you need to regenerate it.

If you receive a timeout error, you can resolve it by increasing the timeout threshold limit.

You might receive a 401 error (unauthorized) expiration error. The error is normally caused by an expired key. If the key is expired, you can regenerate it.

You might receive 400 and 404 (unavailable) errors returned from an API call when there's no current data available for the date range selected. For example, this error might occur because an enrollment transfer was recently initiated. Data from a specific date and later now resides in a new enrollment. Otherwise, the error might occur if you're using a new enrollment number to retrieve information that resides in an old enrollment.
