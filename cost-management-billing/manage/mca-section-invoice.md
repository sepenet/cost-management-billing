# Organize costs by customizing your billing account

Your billing account for Microsoft Customer Agreement provides you flexibility to organize your costs based on your needs whether it's by department, project, or development environment.

This article describes how you can use the Azure portal to organize your costs. It applies to a billing account for a Microsoft Customer Agreement. [Check if you have access to a Microsoft Customer Agreement](#check-access-to-a-microsoft-customer-agreement).

## Structure your account with billing profiles and invoice sections

In the billing account for a Microsoft Customer Agreement, you use billing profiles and invoice sections to organize your costs.

### Billing profile

A billing profile represents an invoice and the related billing information such as payment methods and billing address. A monthly invoice is generated at the beginning of the month for each billing profile in your account. The invoice contains charges for Azure usage and other purchases from the previous month.

A billing profile is automatically created along with your billing account when you sign up for Azure. You may create additional billing profiles to organize your costs in multiple monthly invoices.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Creating additional billing profiles may impact your overall cost. For more information, see [Things to consider when adding new billing profiles](#things-to-consider-when-adding-new-billing-profiles).

### Invoice section

An invoice section represents a grouping of costs in your invoice. An invoice section is automatically created for each billing profile in your account. You may create additional sections to organize your costs based on your needs. Each invoice section is displayed on the invoice with the charges incurred that month.

The image below shows an invoice with two invoice sections - Engineering and Marketing. The summary and detail charges for each section is displayed in the invoice. The prices shown in the image are for example purposes only and don't represent the actual prices of Azure services.

## Things to consider when adding new billing profiles

### Azure usage charges may be impacted

In your billing account for a Microsoft Customer Agreement, Azure usage is aggregated monthly for each billing profile. The prices for Azure resources with tiered pricing are determined based on the usage for each billing profile separately. The usage is not aggregated across billing profiles when calculating the price. This may impact overall cost of Azure usage for accounts with multiple billing profiles.

Let's look at an example of how costs vary for two scenarios. The prices used in the scenarios are for example purposes only and don't represent the actual prices of Azure services.

#### You only have one billing profile.

Let's assume you're using Azure block blob storage, which costs USD .00184 per GB for first 50 terabytes (TB) and then .00177 per GB for next 450 terabytes (TB). You used 100 TB in the subscriptions that are billed to your billing profile, here's how much you would be charged.

|  Tier pricing (USD) |Quantity | Amount (USD)|
|---------|---------|---------|
|1.84 per TB for the first 50 TB/month    | 50 TB        | 92.0   |
|1.77 per TB for the next 450 TB/month    |  50 TB         | 88.5   |
|Total     |     100 TB  | 180.5

The total charges for using 100 TB of data in this scenario is **180.5**

#### You have multiple billing profiles.

Now, let's assume you created another billing profile and used 50 GB through subscriptions that are billed to the first billing profile and 50 GB through subscriptions that are billed to the second billing profile, here's how much you would be charged.

`Charges for the first billing profile`

|  Tier pricing (USD) |Quantity | Amount (USD)|
|---------|---------|---------|
|1.84 per TB for the first 50 TB/month    | 50 TB        | 92.0  |
|1.77 per TB for the next 450 TB/month    |  0 TB         | 0.0  |
|Total     |     50 TB  | 92.0

`Charges for the second billing profile`

|  Tier pricing (USD) |Quantity | Amount (USD)|
|---------|---------|---------|
|1.84 per TB for the first 50 TB/month    | 50 TB        | 92.0  |
|1.77 per TB for the next 450 TB/month    |  0 TB         | 0.0  |
|Total     |     50 TB  | 92.0

The total charges for using 100 TB of data in this scenario is **184.0** (92.0 * 2).

### Azure reservation benefits might not apply to all subscriptions

Azure reservations with shared scope are applied to subscriptions in a single billing profile and are not shared across billing profiles.

![Info graphic for reservation application for different billing account structure](./media/mca-section-invoice/mca-reservations-benefits-by-bg.png)

In the above image, Contoso has two subscriptions. The Azure Reservation benefit is applied differently depending on how the billing account is structured. In the scenario on the left, the reservation benefit is applied to both subscriptions being billed to the engineering billing profile. In the scenario on the right, the reservation benefit will only be applied to subscription 1 since it’s the only subscription being billed to the engineering billing profile.
