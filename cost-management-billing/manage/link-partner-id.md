# Link a partner ID to your Azure accounts

Microsoft partners provide services that help customers achieve business and mission objectives using Microsoft products. When acting on behalf of the customer managing, configuring, and supporting Azure services, the partner users will need access to the customerâ€™s environment. Using Partner Admin Link(PAL), partners can associate their partner network ID with the credentials used for service delivery.

PAL enables Microsoft to identify and recognize partners who drive Azure customer success.Microsoft can attribute influence and Azure consumed revenue to your organization based on the account's permissions (RBAC role) and scope (subscription, resource group, resource ).

## Get access from your customer

Before you link your partner ID, your customer must give you access to their Azure resources by using one of the following options:

- **Guest user**: Your customer can add you as a guest user and assign any role-based access control (RBAC) roles. For more information, see [Add guest users from another directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-b2b-what-is-azure-ad-b2b).

- **Directory account**: Your customer can create a user account for you in their own directory and assign any RBAC role.

- **Service principal**: Your customer can add an app or script from your organization in their directory and assign any RBAC role. The identity of the app or script is known as a service principal.

- **Azure Lighthouse**: Your customer can delegate a subscription (or resource group) so that your users can work on it from within your tenant. For more information, see [Azure delegated resource management](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/lighthouse/concepts/azure-delegated-resource-management).

## Link to a partner ID

When you have access to the customer's resources, use the Azure portal, PowerShell, or the Azure CLI to link your Microsoft Partner Network ID (MPN ID) to your user ID or service principal. Link the partner ID in each customer tenant.

### Use the Azure portal to link to a new partner ID

2. Sign in to the Azure portal.

**Which MPN ID should I use if my company has multiple?**

Partner Location Accounts and associated MPN IDs should be used for linking partner ID.  Learn more about [Partner Accounts](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/account-structure)

**Where can I find influenced revenue reporting for linked partner ID?**

Cloud Product Performance reporting is available to partners in Partner Center at [My Insights dashboard](https://partner.microsoft.com/membership/reports/myinsights). You need to select Partner Admin Link as the partner association type.

**Why can't I see my customer in the reports?**

You can't see the customer in the reports due to following reasons

1. The linked user account doesn't have [Role Based Access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) on any customer Azure subscription or resource.

2. The Azure subscription where the user has [Role Based Access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) access doesn't have any usage.

**Does link partner ID works with Azure Stack?**

Yes, You can link your partner ID for Azure Stack.

**How do I link my partner ID if my company uses [Azure Lighthouse](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/lighthouse/overview) to access customer resources?**

If you onboard customers to Azure delegated resource management by [publishing a managed services offer to Azure Marketplace](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/lighthouse/how-to/publish-managed-services-offers), your MPN ID will automatically be associated. If you [onboard customers by deploying Azure Resource Manager templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/lighthouse/how-to/onboard-customer), you'll need to associate your Microsoft Partner Network (MPN) ID with at least one user account that has access to each of your onboarded subscriptions. Note that you'll need to do this in your service provider tenant. For simplicity, we recommend creating a service principal account in your tenant that is associated your MPN ID and granting it Reader access to every customer you onboard. In this example, the RBAC Reader role is used and it is one of the roles that isn't eligible for Partner Earned Credit. For more information about roles, see [Roles and permissions for partner earned credit](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE3QuW2).
