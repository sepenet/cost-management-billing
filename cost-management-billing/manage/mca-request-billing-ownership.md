# Get billing ownership of Azure subscriptions from other accounts

You might want to take over ownership of Azure subscriptions if the existing billing owner is leaving your organization, or you want to pay for the subscriptions through your billing account. Taking ownership transfers billing responsibilities of subscriptions to your account.

This article applies to a billing account for a Microsoft Customer Agreement. [Check if you have access to a Microsoft Customer Agreement](#check-for-access).

To request the billing ownership, you must be an **invoice section owner** or **invoice section contributor**. To learn more, see [invoice section roles tasks](understand-mca-roles.md#invoice-section-roles-and-tasks).

## Request billing ownership

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) as an invoice section owner or contributor for a billing account for Microsoft Customer Agreement.

2. Search for **Cost Management + Billing**.

3. In the billing scopes page, select the billing account, which would be used to pay for the subscriptions' usage. The billing account should be of type **Microsoft Customer Agreement**.

    > [!NOTE]
    >
    > Azure portal remembers the last billing scope that you access and displays the scope the next time you come to Cost Management + Billing page. You won't see the billing scopes page if you have visited Cost Management + Billing earlier. If so, check that you are in the [right scope](#check-for-access). If not, [switch the scope](view-all-accounts.md#switch-billing-scope-in-the-azure-portal) to select the billing account for a Microsoft Customer Agreement.

4. Select **Billing profiles** from the left-hand side.

    > [!Note]
    >
    > If you don't see Billing profiles, you are not in the right billing scope. You need to select a billing account for a Microsoft Customer Agreement and then select Billing profiles. To learn how to change scopes, see [Switch billing scopes in the Azure portal](view-all-accounts.md#switch-billing-scope-in-the-azure-portal).

5. Select a **Billing profile** from the list. Once you take over the ownership of the subscriptions, their usage  will be billed to this billing profile.

6. Select **Invoice sections** from the left-hand side.

    ![Screenshot that shows selecting invoice sections](./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/mca-select-invoice-sections.png)   

7. Select an invoice section from the list. Once you take over the ownership of the subscriptions, their usage will be assigned to this section of the billing profile's invoice.

8. Select **Transfer requests** from the lower-left side and then select **Add a new request**.

The user must be an Account Administrator on a Microsoft Online Service Program billing account or an account owner on an Enterprise Agreement. For more information, see [view your billing accounts in Azure portal](view-all-accounts.md). Select **Send transfer request**.

## Additional information

The following section provides additional information about transferring subscriptions.

### No service downtime

Azure services in the subscription keep running without any interruption. We only transition the billing relationship for the Azure subscriptions that the user selects to transfer.

### Disabled subscriptions

Disabled subscriptions can't be transferred. Subscriptions must be in active state to transfer their billing ownership.

### Azure resources transfer

All resources from the subscriptions like VMs, disks, and websites transfer.

### Azure Marketplace products transfer

Azure Marketplace products transfer along with their respective subscriptions.

### Azure Reservations transfer

If you're transferring Enterprise Agreement (EA) subscriptions, Azure Reservations don't automatically move with the subscriptions. [Contact Azure support](https://portal.azure.com/?#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade) to move Reservations.

### Access to Azure services

Access for existing users, groups, or service principals that was assigned using (Azure RBAC (role-based access control))[../role-based-access-control/overview.md] is not affected during the transition.

### Azure support plan

Azure support doesn't transfer with the subscriptions. If the user transfers all Azure subscriptions, ask them to cancel their support plan.

### Charges for transferred subscription

The original billing owner of the subscriptions is responsible for any charges that were reported up to the point that the transfer is completed. Your invoice section is responsible for charges reported from the time of transfer onwards. There may be some charges that took place before transfer but was reported afterwards. These charges show up on your invoice section.

### Cancel a transfer request

You can cancel the transfer request until the request is approved or declined. To cancel the transfer request, go to the [transfer details page](#check-the-transfer-request-status) and select cancel from the bottom of the page.

### Software as a Service (SaaS) transfer

SaaS products don't transfer with the subscriptions. Ask the user to [Contact Azure support](https://portal.azure.com/?#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade) to transfer billing ownership of SaaS products. Along with the billing ownership, the user can also transfer resource ownership. Resource ownership lets you perform management operations like deleting and viewing the details of the product. User must be a resource owner on the SaaS product to transfer resource ownership.
